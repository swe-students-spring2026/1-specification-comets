## Stakeholders

### Linda (Family Caregiver):

Goals/needs:

- I want to find a reliable nurse who can visit my parent at a fixed, recurring time so that their routine stays stable and I don’t have to reorganize my work schedule constantly.
- I want to be able to monitor visits remotely and receive notifications when the nurse arrives, leaves, or reports something important so that I feel reassured even when I’m not physically there.
- I want to clearly see each nurse’s license verification, experience with elderly patients, and reviews so that I can confidently choose someone qualified.
- I want transparent pricing and a clear cancellation policy before booking so that I can budget long-term care costs without unexpected fees.

Problems/Frustrations:

- It took me weeks to find a nurse through word of mouth in NYC, and most online listings were outdated or unresponsive.
- I often feel anxious about whether a nurse will show up on time or cancel last minute, especially when I cannot leave work to step in.
- Coordinating schedules, payments, and communication through calls and texts feels disorganized and stressful.
- I worry about scams or unverified caregivers when using random websites or forums, especially when it involves my parent’s safety and medical needs.

### Megan (Administrator):

Goals/needs:

- I want to verify nurse licenses and credentials before they are approved on the platform so that patients can trust that every listed nurse is legitimate and qualified.
- I want to monitor user feedback, complaints, and ratings so that I can quickly identify unsafe behavior or recurring service issues.
- I want to have access to activity logs, such as bookings, cancellations, disputes, and payments, so that I can investigate conflicts fairly and transparently.
- I want tools to suspend or remove nurses or patients who violate platform policies so that the platform maintains safety and professional standards.

Problems/Frustrations:

- If verification is done manually through emails and spreadsheets, it becomes slow and error-prone, especially as the platform grows.
- It is difficult to detect fake licenses or fraudulent users without a centralized verification system.
- Negative reviews or disputes can escalate quickly if there is no structured process to investigate and respond.
- Without clear data dashboards, it is hard to identify patterns such as repeated cancellations, suspicious activity, or low-rated providers.

### Dr. Martin (NYC Health Commissioner):

Goals/needs:

- I want platforms that connect nurses with elderly residents to comply with state licensing and healthcare regulations so that patient safety is not compromised.
- I want access to anonymized usage statistics from the platform so that the city can identify areas with high demand and limited nurse availability.
- I want mechanisms in place to prevent fraud, impersonation, or unsafe medical practices so that vulnerable residents are protected.
- I want clear accountability structures, like audit logs and complaint tracking, so that regulatory oversight is possible if needed.

Problems/Frustrations:

- Many digital health platforms operate in gray areas without clear regulation, which creates legal and ethical risks.
- Much of freelance caregiving happens privately without centralized oversight, making it difficult to monitor quality and safety standards.
- Unverified providers may endanger elderly residents if licensing and credential checks are not enforced properly.
- When complaints arise, platforms often lack structured documentation or traceability, making investigations hard.

## Product Vision Statement

To create a trusted mobile platform that connects verified freelance nurses with elderly patients in need of reliable and flexible care.

## User Requirements

### Elderly Patient

- As an elderly patient, I want to enter my care needs, such as medication help and mobility support, so I can be matched with a nurse who fits my situation.
- As an elderly patient, I want to search for nurses by location and availability, so I can find someone nearby who can come to my home when I need them or in case of any emergencies.
- As an elderly patient, I want to view a nurse’s profile, including but not limited to his/her license status, experience, languages, and services, so I can decide if I trust and prefer them.
- As an elderly patient, I want to book a visit for a specific date and time with only some taps on the app, so I can schedule care without phone calls or email.
- As an elderly patient, I want to save my preferred nurses as favorites, so I can quickly rebook someone I already know and trust.
- As an elderly patient, I want to add accessibility preferences like hearing support or wheelchair-friendly visits, so I can receive care that fits my physical needs.
- As an elderly patient, I want to choose in-home services like wound dressing or vital checks, so I can request the exact type of care I need without confusion.
- As an elderly patient, I want to be able to write reviews and/or ratings for nurses, so I can provide feedback on my experience.
- As an elderly patient, I want to be able to choose a freelance nurse at a suitable price, so I can stay within my budget.

### Family Caregiver

- As a family caregiver, I want to book recurring visits, so I can worry less and have my family members receive stable care on a routine basis.
- As a family caregiver, I want to see transparent pricing and a cancellation policy before booking, so I can be prepared for any unexpected charges.
- As a family caregiver, I want to receive notifications when a nurse accepts the order, is en route, arrives, or is running late, so I can stay informed about any situation.

### Freelance Nurse

- As a freelance nurse, I want to submit my license and identity for verification, so I can be trusted with proof of qualifications, and I can get straight to work.
- As a freelance nurse, I want to set my availability and service area, so I can only receive requests when and where I am free.
- As a freelance nurse, I want to message the patient along with caregivers of any emergency on the road, absence, or any missing information, so I can contact the clients seamlessly and reduce misunderstandings.

### Platform Administrator

- As a platform administrator, I want to flag suspicious accounts or inconsistent credentials, so I can protect patients and maintain trust in the marketplace.
